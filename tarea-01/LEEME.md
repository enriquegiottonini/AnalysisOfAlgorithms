First assignment for the Analysis of Algorithms class.
It consist in comparing different basic sorting algorithms by timing
their execution time. As well a big O analysis. And to refresh C ;).

Usage: In terminal/shell run `make` or `make bench` to compile object files and run benchmark.
Benchmarking takes 17 seg, so results are also provided in `results_benchmark.txt`.

For running tests run `make test`.
For cleaning object files run  `make clean`.
